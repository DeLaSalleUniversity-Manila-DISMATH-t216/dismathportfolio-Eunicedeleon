##WEEK 1

- I was introduced to Discrete Mathematics: what it is and what it is used for.
- I was introduced to all the topics that will be discussed during the whole term.
- Learned about propositions and the use of logical deduction.
- Learned how to determine truth values and make a truth table.
- Learned different symbols used in logic:

| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Operator | Usage | For Truth Tables |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| ¬ |Negation | not | subtract 1|
| ∧ | Conjunction | and | min, multiplication |
| ∨ | Disjunction | or | max, addition |
| ⊕ | Exclusive disjunction | xor | 
| → | Conditional | if, then |
| ↔ | Biconditional | iff |


##WEEK 2

- Learned about Logical Equivalences and how to use them to prove propositions.

- Learned about Quantifiers

- Learned about the Rules of Inference:
  - Modus Ponens
  - Modus Tollens
  - Hypothetical Syllogism
  - Addition
  - Simplification
  - Conjunction
  - Resolution
- Learned how to use the Rules of Inference to prove a set of arguments.
- Learned that it is easier to use Rules of Inference than using Truth Tables when dealing with many variables.

##WEEK 3

- Learned about the different types of proofs:
 - **Direct Proof** (p→q) 
   - Step 1: Assume p is true
    - Step 2: Show q is true
 - **Proof by Contraposition** (¬q→¬p)
   - Step 1: Assume ¬q is true
    - Step 2: Show ¬p is true
 - **Vacuous Proof** (¬p→(p→q)) 
   - Step 1: Show that p is false
 - **Trivial Proof** (q→(p→q))
   - Step 1: Show that q is true
 - **Proof by Contradiction** (p) 
   - Step 1: Show that assuming ¬p(whole premise) is true leads to a contradiction 
 - **Proof by Equivalence** (p↔q)
   - Step 1: Show that p→q and q→p are both true
 - **Mathematical Induction**
   - Step 1: Substitution (Basis) 
    - Step 2: Direct Proof (Inductive) 

##WEEK 4

- I got reminded of Summation
- Learned more about proofs through the excercises we did
- Learned about Recursive Proofs
  - Step 1: Basis (specify value) 
  - Step 2: Recursive
